# AuthRemoteuser: A MediaWiki Extension

Based on AuthRemoteuser, this extension allows integration with the ProductOpener
authentication system via it's session cookie. If an account with that name does
not exist yet, one is created.

## Installation
First, add this to your `LocalSettings.php`:

    ####################################################
    # Extension: AuthProductOpener
    wfLoadExtension( 'AuthProductOpener' );
    $wgAuthProductOpenerDomain = 'world.openfoodfacts.org';
    
    # If you want the extension to autocreate users not existing you have to add 
    $wgGroupPermissions['*']['autocreateaccount'] = true;
    
    # Settings: AuthRemoteuser
    $wgGroupPermissions['*']['createaccount']   = false;
    $wgGroupPermissions['*']['read']            = false;
    $wgGroupPermissions['*']['edit']            = false;
